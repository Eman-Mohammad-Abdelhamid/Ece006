            High-level programming languages High-level programming languages include programming
            languages that use a format familiar to programmers when used in writing
            programs, where the commands written in them are called code, and the
            symbols and vocabulary used in writing the code are close to the vocabulary
            of the English language, and high-level languages provide the ability
            to Adding a lot of comments, and explanations within the program that
            the programmer is working on; Which makes these programs easier, and
            increases their readability, and modification from the user himself,
            or even from other users. The reason why this type of language is called
            high-level languages is because it is far from the language that the
            computer understands, and its proximity to the language understood
            by humans, so writing programs through this type of language is easier
            and faster than writing them in low-level programming languages, and
            high-level languages do not depend on computer type; They are designed
            to work on different computers, regardless of their type or operating
            system. Examples...

          <p>
            Low-level programming languages are defined as programming languages that are written
            through the binary number system represented by the numbers: 0, and
            1, so that a computer can understand them, and unlike high-level languages,
            low-level languages are complex and unreadable by programmers, This
            type of language includes two branches of languages, which are the
            following: • Machine Language: It is the language that only computers
            can understand, and these programs are represented by the binary system,
            and the process of writing these programs is a very complicated matter
            for programmers, and the language of the machine varies from one computer
            to another, as programs are created in the processors on the devices,
            and therefore cannot be Using software written in machine language
            on a device containing a PowerPC processor on another device containing
            a processor Intel. • Assembly Language: Assembly language is relatively
            easier than machine language; This is because it contains some vocabulary
            of the English language; Like the word add and sub, for example, which
            makes its programs easier to read and understand compared to machine
            language programs. Programs of this level of programming languages
            act as a translator that converts high-level human-written language
            programs into machine language understood by machines, as in Machine
            Language Assembly languages are not portable; That is, a program written
            in assembly language cannot be transferred from one computer to another...
