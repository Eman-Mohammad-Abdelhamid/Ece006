          <p>
            1.​​according to the way programs are implemented. Interpreted languages ​​are
            defined as languages ​​whose programming commands are translated and
            converted into machine language when written by the translator. Programs
            of this type of language are not translated into the machine language
            of the processor itself, but rather by using a program specific to
            the language itself. It's called an interpreter. Interpreting languages
            ​​are a bit slow; Because it converts commands into machine language
            on a regular basis, and on the other hand, these languages ​​have many
            advantages, including: The ability to run the program on different
            computers and on multiple operating systems, as this requires downloading
            a copy of the programming language on the device on which the program
            is to be run, and the commands of programs written in this type of
            language are permanently readable and modified, and Python is one example
            On this type of programming languages, translated languages ​​are defined
            as languages ​​that convert Software commands or code into the machine
            language of the device after the completion of writing the entire program,
            and the conversion from the programming language in which the program
            was written to the machine language is done using what is known as
            the translator. This type is characterized by of languages ​​at the
            speed of operation; Where the program is run directly without the need
            to convert commands first hand, however, programs of this type of programming
            languages ​​cannot be transferred and run on devices running operating
            systems different from those contained in the device on which the program
            was written, and the C language is one of the examples on this type
            of programming languages. 2.according to their uses, different programming
            languages ​​are classified according to the type of use as follows
            * Application and software development languages: They are languages
            ​​that are concerned with developing programs and different applications
            that the user deals With daily, and they are C, C#, and C++, Java,
            and Visual Basic are the most famous examples of this type of programming
            language. * Artificial intelligence development languages: These are
            the languages ​​for developing artificial intelligence programs; As
            robotics programs, Prolog, Python, AIML, C, C#, and C++ are examples
            of languages ​​that can be used to develop various AI software. 3.Database
            development languages: These are the languages ​​that are used by grammar
            code programmers; With the aim of creating and maintaining its operation,
            an example of this type of language is SQL. 4.Game development languages:
            These are those concerned with developing computer games, or any other
            entertainment programs; C++, Java, C#, and Dark BASIC. 5.Computer hardware
            operating system development languages: These languages ​​are concerned
            with developing programs needed to create computer hardware operating
            systems and their various interfaces. C and Assembly are examples of
            them. 6.Internet development languages ​​and web pages: These languages
            ​​are the basis for the existence of the Internet in the world, through
            which websites and their browsers are designed, and HTML, HDML, Java,
            JavaScript, PHP, XML and Python are examples of this type of programming
            languages.
